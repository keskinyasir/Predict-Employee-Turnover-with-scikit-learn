# Predict-Employee-Turnover-with-scikit-learn

we will apply decision trees and random forests using scikit-learn and Python to build an employee churn prediction application with interactive controls and accomplish this with the help of following tasks in the project:

Introduction and Import Libraries
Exploratory Data Analysis
Encode Categorical Features
Visualize Class Imbalance
Create Training and Test Sets
Build a Decision Tree Classifier with Interactive Controls
Build a Random Forest Classifier with Interactive Controls
Feature Importance Plots and Evaluation Metrics

Result:
Random Forest perform much better than Decision Tree
