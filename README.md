# Predict-Employee-Turnover-with-scikit-learn

we will apply decision trees and random forests using scikit-learn and Python to build an employee churn prediction application with interactive controls and accomplish this with the help of following tasks in the project:

  1:  Introduction and Import Libraries,
  
  2:  Exploratory Data Analysis,
  
  3:  Encode Categorical Features,
  
  4:  Visualize Class Imbalance,
  
  5:  Create Training and Test Sets,
  
  6:  Build a Decision Tree Classifier with Interactive Controls,
  
  7:  Build a Random Forest Classifier with Interactive Controls,
  
  8:  Feature Importance Plots and Evaluation Metrics,

Result:
Random Forest perform much better than Decision Tree
